# US Core Test Kit

This is an [Inferno](https://github.com/inferno-community/inferno-core) test kit
for the [US Core Implementation Guide
v3.1.1](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/).

It is highly recommended that you use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run
these tests so that you don't have to configure ruby and the FHIR validator
service.

## Instructions

- Clone this repo.
- Run `setup.sh` in this repo.
- Run `run.sh` in this repo.
- Navigate to `http://localhost`. The US Core test suite will be available.
